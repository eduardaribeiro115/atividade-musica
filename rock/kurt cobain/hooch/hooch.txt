[Verse 1]
Los ticka toe rest
Might like a sender doe ree
Your make a doll a ray day sender
Bright like a penalty
Exi-tease my ray day member
Half-lost a beat away
Purst in like a one-way sender
War give a heart like a fay

[Chorus]
'Cause I can ford a red-eed
Only street a wide a re-land
Diamond make a mid-evil
Bike a sake a like a re-caste
'Cause I can ford a red-eed
Only street a wide a re-land
On a re-land
Find a re-land

[Verse 2]
You sink-a my swan
Rolly a get a worst in
Maybe minus way far central
Poor forty duck a pin
Milkmaid dud bean
Master a load a head
Pill pop a dope a well run
General hash pump a gonna led
