[Verse 1]
And if I may, and if I might
Lay me down weeping
And if I say, what is life?
I might be dreaming
If I may, what is right?
Summertime, see me yield
Those years in his body
A phrase from his pocket
In chains from the no-end, lifelong dream

[Chorus]
Re mi
Re mi
Well, do re mi
Do re mi

[Verse 2]
If I may and if I might
Wake me up and see me
If I do, and if I lie
Find me out, to see me
And if I'm made, cold as ice
I may have to see me heal
Raised in his own care
Erased from this moment
The change from his socket
That I may need
