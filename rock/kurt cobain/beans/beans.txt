[Chorus]
Beans, beans, beans
Jessie ate some beans
He was happy, happy, happy
That he ate some beans

[Verse 1]
Sitting naked, naked
Sitting cross legged
Naked, naked, naked
And he was happy, happy, happy
That he ate some beans

[Verse 2]
Wine, wine, wine
Jessie ate some wine
He was happy, happy, happy
That he ate some wine

[Chorus]
Beans, beans, beans
Jessie ate some beans
And he drank some wine
And he was happy, happy, happy
That he drank some bean
