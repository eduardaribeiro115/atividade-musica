[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm taking my ride with destiny
Willing to play my part
Living with painful memories
Loving with all my heart

[Chorus]
Made in heaven, made in heaven
It was all meant to be, yeah
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what they say
Can't you see?
That's what everybody says to me
Can't you see?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh I know, I know, I know that it's true
Yes, it's really meant to be
Deep in my heart

[Verse 2]
I'm having to learn to pay the price
They're turning me upside down
Waiting for possibilities
Don't see too many around
