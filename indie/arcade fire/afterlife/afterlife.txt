Afterlife, oh my God, what an awful word
After all the breath, and the dirt, and the fires are burnt
And after all this time, and after all the ambulances go
And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on to the dead light
Of the afterglow
I've gotta know

[Chorus]
Can we work it out?
We scream and shout ‘til we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout ‘til we work it out?
‘Til we work it out, ‘til we work it out
‘Til we work it out, ‘til we work it out

[Verse 2]
Afterlife, I think I saw what happens next
Oh, it was just a glimpse of you, like looking through a window
Or a shallow sea
Could you see me?
And after all this time
It's like nothing else we used to know
And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on to the dead light
Of the afterglow
I've gotta know
