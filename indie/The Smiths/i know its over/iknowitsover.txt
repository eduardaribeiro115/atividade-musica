Oh, Mother, I can feel
The soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said

[Chorus]
I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over

[Verse 2]
Oh, Mother, I can feel
The soil falling over my head
See, the sea wants to take me, the knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Though she needs you more than she loves you

[Chorus]
And I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over and over and over and over, over and over
I know it's over, and it never really began
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said
