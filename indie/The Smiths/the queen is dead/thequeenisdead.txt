"Oh, take me back to dear old Blighty
Put me on the train for London Town
Take me anywhere, drop me anywhere
In Liverpool, Leeds or Birmingham, but I don't care
I should like to seeâ€”"

[Drum Solo]

[Verse 1]
(I don't bless them)
Farewell to this land's cheerless marshes
Hemmed in like a boar between archers
Her very lowness with her head in a sling
I'm truly sorry, but it sounds like a wonderful thing
I say, Charles, don't you ever crave
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your mother's bridal veil?
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
And so I checked all the registered historical facts
And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the eighteenth pale descendent
Of some old queen or other
Oh, has the world changed or have I changed?
Oh, has the world changed or have I changed?
Some nine year old tough who peddles drugs
I swear to God, I swear I never even knew what drugs were
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
