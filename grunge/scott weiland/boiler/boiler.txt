[Verse 1]
Looks like I'ma do everything myself
Maybe I could use some help
But hell, you want somethin' done right?
You gotta do it yourself!
Maybe life is up and down
But, my life's been what 'til now?
I crawled up your butt somehow
And that's when things got turned around
I used to be alive, now I feel pathetic and now I get it
What's done is done, you just leave it alone and don't regret it
Sometimes some things turn into dumb things
And that's when you put your foot down

[Chorus]
Why'd I have to go and meet somebody like you, like you?
Why'd you have to go and hurt somebody like me, like me?
How could you do somebody like that? (Like that)
Hope you know that I'm never comin' back (Never comin' back)

[Verse 2]
Looks like I'ma do everything myself (Everything myself)
Maybe I could use some help
But hell, if you want somethin' done right
You just do it yourself! (Got it?)
Maybe life is up and down
But, my life's been what 'til now? (Got it?)
I crawled up your butt somehow (Got it?)
And that's when shit got turned around (Got it!)
I used to be alive – so pathetic, well, now I get it
What's done is done, I know you'll just leave it alone and don't regret it
But sometimes some things turn into dumb things
And that's when you put your foot down

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Depending on you is done
Giving to you is done
No more eating, no sleeping, no living
It's all just more giving to you and I'm done
Depending on you is done
And giving to you is done
No more eating, no sleeping, no living
It's all just more giving to you and I'm done
The hiding from you is done!
The lying from you is done
No more eating, no sleeping, no living
It's all just more giving to you and I'm done

[Chorus]
Why'd I have to go and meet somebody like you, like you?
Why'd you have to go and hurt somebody like me, like me?
How could you do somebody like that?
Hope you know that I'm never coming back (Never comin' back)
Why'd I have to go and meet somebody like you, like you?
Why'd you have to go and hurt somebody like me, like me?
How could you do somebody like that?
Hope you know that I'm never coming back (That I'm never coming back)

[Hidden Track]
Ladies and gentlemen, what you are experiencin'
Is in fact, an interlude
I would like you to kick back
And think about everything you've just heard
