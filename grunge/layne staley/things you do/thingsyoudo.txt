When it rains, It pours on my heart
Sorrow ensoaked though, I dry in the dark
You give me love if I don't misbehave
But you changed your mind and Keep me a slave
This is the last song that I will ever write my reason for writin'
And this is the last song I will ever write about you

(Layne)
I don't believe in love
I don't believe in much
Loves just a weak man's crutch
And I'm stronger than your touch
I don't believe in love
I don't believe in much
I hope the things you do
Touch me within I'm thin and I'm weak
Bring me some life but don't let me speak

I threw my sensitivity against the wall for you, I gave it all to you and you left me.. Stranded!
Whatever outlasted me too long
Well maybe my style, my lead was wrong
And this is the last that song I will ever write about you

(Layne)
I don't believe in love
I don't believe in much
Loves just a weak man's crutch
And I'm stronger than your touch
I don't believe in love
I don't believe in much
I hope the things you do
Touch me within I'm thin and I'm weak
Bring me some life but don't let me speak
