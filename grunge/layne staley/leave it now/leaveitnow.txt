Verse 1]
Feel like you love it
Started falling for me
Falling at the right time, yeah
I didn't fake it, my love
Falling for you
I didn't even have a chance

[Pre-Chorus]
Then we started making out
Then you watched me cry
Middle of the winter, baby, you and I
Don't wanna be
I don't wanna be

Then you said I was a devil
But you're dressed in white
Wishing that you loved
Seeing eye to eye
Don't wanna be
I don't wanna be

[Chorus]
She said I'm over it now
I thought you figured it out
That I'm over it now
(Nighttime coming, now you're running)
I'm over it now
I thought you figured it out
That I'm over it now
(Nighttime coming, now you're running)

[Verse 2]
I think you love me
You won't say it to me
Falling at the right time, yeah
I got this feeling
My heart, one and only
Didn't even have a chance

[Pre-Chorus]
Then we started making out
Then you watched me cry
Middle of the winter, baby, you and I
Don't wanna be
I don't wanna be

[Chorus]
She said I'm over it now
I thought you figured it out
That I'm over it now
(Nighttime coming, now you're running)
I'm over it now
I thought you figured it out
That I'm over it now
(Nighttime coming, now you're running)

[Bridge]
You need something physical
Not me
Something physical
You need something physical
(Nighttime coming, now you're running)
You need something physical
Not me
Something physical
You need something physical
(Nighttime coming, now you're running)
